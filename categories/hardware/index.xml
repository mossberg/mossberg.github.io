      <description>This is a pretty late post, but I wanted to show off the hardware I designed as a follow up to the first &amp;ldquo;Building a Simple IoT Light Switch&amp;rdquo;. In that post I presented a prototype of a smart light switch I designed that consisted of a button which triggered a small Python server running on a Raspberry Pi to control my Phillips Hue lights over an HTTP API. It was an extraordinarily simple design that worked well enough, how it was very inconvenient to transport since I had to rewire the breadboard to the raspi GPIO pins every time I moved.</description>
