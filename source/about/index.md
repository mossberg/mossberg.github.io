### Hi, I'm Mark Mossberg.

I'm a senior at [Northeastern University](http://ece.neu.edu),
studying Computer Engineering and I'm mainly interested in operating
systems, compilers, and systems security.

You might also catch me trying my hand at web/app development, but
don't tell anyone ;).

On campus I'm involved with
[Wireless Club](http://wireless.neu.edu),
and [NU Hacks](http://hacks.io). Sometimes I play
[CTF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security),
and in November 2015 I played in [CSAW](https://csaw.engineering.nyu.edu/ctf/finalists)
with
[Shellphish](https://ctftime.org/team/285).

In my free time I enjoy [slacklining](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacklining),
playing guitar, and working on various [projects](/projects).
