### Hi, I'm Mark Mossberg.

**tl;dr**: I like making and breaking things.

I'm a junior at [Northeastern University](http://ece.neu.edu),
studying Computer Engineering. My main interests include operating systems
and reverse engineering although you might also catch me playing with embedded
systems and web/app development occasionally.

On campus I'm involved with [IEEE](http://ieee.neu.edu),
[Wireless Club](http://wireless.neu.edu), the Northeastern
[CCDC](http://www.nationalccdc.org/) and
[CTF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security) teams,
and [NU Hacks](http://hacks.io).

In my free time I enjoy [slacklining](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacklining),
playing guitar, and working on various projects. In April 2014, I placed in the top three for a Massachusetts [cybersecurity competition](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/05/03/hackers-hone-their-skills-cybersecurity-competition-umass-boston/Jcbnuv3D1Tdc09MYJITs8J/story.html).
